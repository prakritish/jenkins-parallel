# Jenkins - Parallel Builds
The article provides a comprehensive examination of parallel builds within Jenkins pipelines, with a particular emphasis on their application in managing complex pipeline scenarios.
It's essential to highlight that Jenkins' approach to parallel builds, as discussed in the article, can be seen as analogous to GitHub Actions' Matrix Builds. Both Jenkins and GitHub Actions allow for the parallel execution of jobs across different configurations, such as various platforms and versions. However, a key distinction lies in the implementation and flexibility. While GitHub Actions offers a built-in matrix feature for defining parallel jobs easily, Jenkins requires a more scripted approach for achieving similar functionality, as outlined in the article.
This distinction underscores the importance of understanding and tailoring the pipeline tool to suit specific project requirements and preferences.
